# Project's Title:
Code for sea ice thickness reference measurements


# Project Description:
The Climate Change Initiative sea ice thickness Round Robin Data Package (CCI SIT RRDP) is a set of space delimitted ASCII files which contain a range of relevant reference sea ice variables, including sea ice thickness, snow depth, draft and freeboard, along with snow depth and density from Warren climatology (1999) for Arctic. Sea ice surface temperature and air temperature is also provided when available. The data has been gridded into a 25 by 25 km product for Arctic and 50 by 50 km for Antarctic using EASE-grid 2.0 and contains monthly averages of the given gridpoint. Reference data from autonomous buoys, moorings, submarines, ships (ice breakers), airborne campaigns (radar/laser altimetry and electromagnetic induction system) and in-situ measurements is provided in the final dataset. This dataset is available from DTU DATA ([https://figshare.com/s/77be0cfd6842d08f1b6b] / [DOI:10.11583/DTU.23735679](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.24787341)) and described in the publication DOI: **INSERT DOI**.\

This repository provides the code used for processing from raw reference data to the final gridded product and the code used for co-locating reference data to satellite measurements from Envisat, CryoSat-2, ERS-1 and ERS-2. For examples of use, further information and inspiration we refer to the belonging paper: *"Dual-hemisphere sea ice thickness reference measurements from multiple data sources for evaluation and product inter-comparison of satellite altimetry"* with DOI: **INSERT DOI**
We highly recommend potential users of the repository to read the paper.

# How to Install and Run the Project:
The project was made using python version 3.9.13, along with the packages: numpy, matplotlib, cartopy, PyPDF2, netcdf4, pandas and datetime.
Furthermore, NASA's EaseGrid-2.0 was used and modified to make the gridded final data. This script is found in the code folder under the name: EASEgrid_correct

To use the project extract the data from the zip RRDPp zip folder. Download relevant reference data and Satellite data (see table 3 in **INSERT DOI**). See the How to Use the Project section for more information.

# The structure of the project:
The structure of the project is illustrated on the diagrams below, with the blue boxes showning folders and pink boxes showing scripts. Black arrows indicate folder/subfolder connections, whereas the green lines show data/code dependencies. The content of the satellite folder is shown individually.

# How to Use the Project:
Currently the *../RRDPp/FINAL*, *../RRDPp/satellite/Final_files* and *../RRDPp/RawData* folders are left intentionally blank.

Data for the  *../RRDPp/FINAL* and *../RRDPp/satellite/Final_files* folders are readily available for use from DTU DATA
DOI: 10.11583/DTU.23735679 \

The *../RRDPp/code* folder contains the scripts for the individual campaigns which processes the raw data to the final gridded data.\
A folder with the naming convention of the *../RRDPp/code* folder should be made in the *../RRDPp/FINAL* folder.\

In the ../RRDPp/RawData folder the user should locate raw data in folders following the naming convention of the *../RRDPp/code* folder.\ 
Individual links to raw data are available from the belonging publication in table 3 **INSERT DOI WHEN AVAILABLE** \

The *../RRDPp/satellite* folder contains scripts that are related to co-locating data from CryoSat-2, ENVISAT, ERS-1 and ERS-2 to data in the *../RRDPp/FINAL* folder.\

To do the co-location reference data from the CCI SIT RRDP (https://figshare.com/s/77be0cfd6842d08f1b6b / DOI: 10.11583/DTU.23735679 ) and satelitte data from table 3 **INSERT DOI WHEN AVAILABLE** must be downloaded.

For an overview of the satellite folder see the diagram above.\

Temporal and spatial averaging windows are defined in the top of scripts located in the *../RRDPp/code*. This information is used as input to the EASEGRID 2.0 script (EASEgrid_correct.py).
To change spatial and temporal averaging change these parameters.
